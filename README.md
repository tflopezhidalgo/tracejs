TraceJS
=======

Classic `traceroute` command implemented in nodejs. The only dependency is the `raw-socket` library in order to access IP specific fields

#### Why node?

Why not?. Yeah, it's a very high level language, but you can access to low level features like sockets anyway, and I need to practice my javascript coding.

#### Is it finished?

No, is not. The current state of the project is wip
